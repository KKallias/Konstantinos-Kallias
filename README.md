## Summary
Case study Eniac: Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories.
It was founded ten years ago in Spain and has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.
## Languages and Libraries Used
We used SQL and tableau and we made the presentation on Google slides.
Through the Eniac project, I honed my analytical and problem-solving skills, transforming raw data into actionable insights. 
I practiced effective communication by tailoring complex technical findings into clear, engaging narratives for non-technical stakeholders. 
## Additional Reflections
This reinforced the importance of storytelling in data science, bridging the gap between technical expertise and decision-making.
